Not all data has been uploaded from the project proposal file - files that are too big ( can be other ways to use these without downloading them to our local machines ~ if super necessary )

Feel free to change structure, add new files, delete files, suggest workflow ideas. 


For recipe dataset: train to classify 10-15 different classes (10-15 recipes). Multiclassification. There is not enough time to classify all recipes. 

Images: Use pretrained model, object identification, YOLOs?
